# Setlist Player Mode

## User story

As a user, I want to enter player mode for a setlist so that I can present songs with large typography during practice or performance.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Entry point to start player mode from setlist view
- [x] Player mode displays songs in setlist order
- [x] One song shown at a time (large typography)
- [x] Swipe or button to advance to next song (arrow buttons + keyboard)
- [ ] Optional autoscroll
- [x] Dark/light mode support

## Notes

Player mode: large typography, next/previous navigation, dark/light via ThemeProvider. Autoscroll deferred.
