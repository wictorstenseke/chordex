# Add Songs to Setlist

## User story

As a user, I want to add songs from my library to a setlist so that I can build a set for practice or performance.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] UI to add songs when viewing/editing a setlist
- [ ] Song picker or list from user's library
- [ ] Selected songs appended to setlist's songIds (preserving order)
- [ ] Changes persisted to Firestore
- [ ] Added songs visible in setlist immediately

## Notes

songIds: string[] (ordered). Only songs from user's library (or shared songs they've saved) can be added.
