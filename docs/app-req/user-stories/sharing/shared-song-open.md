# Open Shared Song (Read-Only)

## User story

As a recipient, I want to open a shared song link and view it in read-only mode so that I can see the chord chart without modifying it.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Display in read-only mode – no edit controls
- [ ] Banner: "Shared song – read-only"

- [ ] Primary action: "Save to My Songs"
- [ ] If not authenticated: prompt "Sign in to save"

## Notes
