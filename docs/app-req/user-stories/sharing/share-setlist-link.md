# Share Setlist via Link

## User story

As a user, I want to share a setlist via a read-only link so that others can view the set order and songs.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Share action generates a shareable link for setlist
- [ ] Link allows read-only access for recipients
- [ ] Recipients see setlist name, song order, and song content (or links to songs)
- [ ] visibility: "unlisted" enables link sharing
- [ ] Link does not require recipient to sign in to view (for unlisted shares)

## Notes

Sharing Phase 1: Share setlist via link (read-only).
