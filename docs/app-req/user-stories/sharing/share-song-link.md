# Share Song via Link

## User story

As a user, I want to share a song via a read-only link so that others can view my chord chart without editing it.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Share action generates a shareable link
- [ ] Link allows read-only access (no edit) for recipients
- [ ] Visibility: "unlisted" enables link sharing while keeping song out of public discovery
- [ ] Link does not require recipient to sign in to view (for unlisted shares)

## Notes

Sharing Phase 1: Share song via link (read-only). visibility: "unlisted" for shareable links.
