# Player Mode

## User story

As a user, I want a player mode with large typography and easy navigation so that I can read chord charts comfortably during practice or performance.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Swipe or next/previous button for song navigation
- [ ] Optional autoscroll through lyrics
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle
- [ ] Minimal UI – focus on content
- [ ] Works for single song view and setlist flow

Player mode from mvp-desc-scope.md:

Clear mode separation: Edit Mode, View Mode, Player Mode.
