# Live Preview (Chords Rendered Above Lyrics)

## User story

As a user, I want to see chords rendered above lyrics as I edit so that I can verify how the song will display in view/player mode.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Live preview pane or toggle when editing
- [x] ChordPro content parsed and chords rendered above lyrics
- [x] Preview updates as user edits
- [x] Rendered format matches view mode and player mode display

## Notes

Chords rendered above lyrics – standard ChordPro display. Clear mode separation: Edit Mode, View Mode, Player Mode.
