# Duplicate Song

## User story

As a user, I want to duplicate a song so that I can create variations (e.g., different keys) without re-entering from scratch.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Duplicate action available from song list or song detail
- [x] New song created with copied metadata and content
- [x] New song has new ID and is owned by current user
- [x] Duplicate does not copy source metadata (source is for shared-song imports only)
- [x] Redirect to edit mode for new song

## Notes

Different from "Save to My Songs" from shared link – that flow adds source metadata. Duplicate is for copying one's own songs.
