# Firebase Setup

## User story

As a developer, I want Firebase (Firestore + Auth) configured in the app so that users can store songs, setlists, and authenticate.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Firebase project created and app registered
- [ ] Firestore database enabled
- [ ] Authentication enabled (appropriate sign-in methods)
- [ ] Firebase config wired into app via environment variables
- [ ] Firestore SDK initialized in app
- [ ] Auth SDK initialized in app

## Notes

Tech stack from mvp-desc-scope.md:
- Firestore for data (songs, setlists)
- Auth for users
