# Firebase Setup

## User story

As a developer, I want Firebase (Firestore + Auth) configured in the app so that users can store songs, setlists, and authenticate.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Firebase project created and app registered (manual – Firebase Console)
- [ ] Firestore database enabled (manual – Firebase Console)
- [ ] Authentication enabled (manual – Firebase Console)
- [x] Firebase config wired into app via environment variables
