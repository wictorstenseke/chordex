# TanStack Router Conventions

## File Structure

- Route files live in `src/routes/` and export `Route` using `createFileRoute()`
- Page components live in `src/pages/`, imported by route files
- Root layout is defined in `src/routes/__root.tsx`
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated output; never edit it manually

## Navigation

- Use typed `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router` for navigation
- Avoid raw `<a>` tags for internal navigation

## Route Parameters

- Define route params with Zod validation when applicable
- Use `useParams()` and `useSearch()` hooks for accessing route data

## Route Tree Generation

- Generate routes with `tsr generate` when route files change outside the dev watcher
- Keep route generation wired through project scripts (`prepare`, `generate:routes`, `type-check`, and `build`)
- Do not switch generation back to `postinstall`; use `prepare` for install-time compatibility
